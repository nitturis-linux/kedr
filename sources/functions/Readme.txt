This is a kind of a "function data base": the information about the kernel 
functions KEDR can process by default is stored here.

The functions are organized in groups for convenience. These groups have 
nothing to do with the groups of functions the payload modules use. These 
sets of groups are not required to match. Same for the groups of functions 
used by the call interception tests.
