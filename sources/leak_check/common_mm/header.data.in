/* If call_rcu() is used, it can be necessary to check if the pointer

 * call kfree or a similar function on the containing structure. 
 *
 * N.B. We do not rely on __is_kfree_rcu_offset() to check the address
 * because this function is probably more likely to be changed in the 
 * future (to make it possible to use kmem_cache_free(), for example).*/
