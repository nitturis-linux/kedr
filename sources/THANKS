Special thanks to (in no particular order):

Konstantin Vlasov - for helpful discussions of the usage scenarios
Vladimir Rubanov and Alexey Khoroshilov - for their efforts to 
  promote KEDR on the market
Denis Silakov - for his help in testing KEDR in some rather uncommon
  situations
Denis Yefremov - for his advice on how to improve KEDR, especially,
  when Arch Linux systems are concerned

... and, of course, to all people who use KEDR, who reported problems
in it, suggested new features, contributed code or helped the project 
in some other way.
