Special thanks to (in no particular order):

Konstantin Vlasov - for helpful discussions of KEDR usage scenarios
Vladimir Rubanov and Alexey Khoroshilov - for their efforts to 
  promote KEDR on the market
Denis Silakov - for his help in testing KEDR in some rather uncommon
  situations

... and, of course, to all people who use KEDR, who reported problems
in it, suggested new features or helped the project in some other way.
