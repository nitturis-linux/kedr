Special thanks to (in no particular order):

Konstantin Vlasov - for helpful discussions of KEDR usage scenarios.
Vladimir Rubanov - for his efforts to promote KEDR on the market.

... and, of course, to all people who reported problems in KEDR, suggested 
new features or helped the project in some other way.
