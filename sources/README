KEDR Framework
--------------
KEDR framework provides the tools for runtime analysis (especially, 
verification) of kernel-mode drivers on Linux (KEDR is an acronym 
for KErnel-mode Drivers in Runtime). The framework is intended to be used 
by the driver developers and may be useful for the driver certification 
systems as well.

The tools provided by KEDR operate on a driver chosen by the user (target 
driver). They monitor kernel function calls made by the driver, perform 
fault simulation, etc. This may complement many existing tools for error 
detection, fault simulation, memory checking, etc., that operate on the 
Linux kernel as a whole.

The typical usage of KEDR is essentially as follows. The user works with 
the target driver as usual or probably runs some specific tests on it. At 
the same time, KEDR tools are monitoring the operation of the driver, 
checking if it works correctly, doing fault simulation if requested, 
dumping the data about the actions made by the driver to some kind of a 
trace for future analysis, etc. 

KEDR framework is designed to be easy to extend and build upon. For 
example, the set of kernel functions to be monitored is fully customizable; 
fault simulation scenarios can also be provided and controlled by the user. 
Besides that, KEDR provides an interface to implement custom types of 
analysis via pluggable modules - in addition to call monitoring and fault 
simulation.

Currently, KEDR works on x86 and x86-64 architectures.
