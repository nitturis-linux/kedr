KEDR 0.3

    * Util: Revisited and simplified stack trace-related API
save_stack_trace() function is not always available in the kernel, even
if reliable stack traces are supported (that is, CONFIG_STACKTRACE may
be undefined in this case too).

kedr_save_stack_trace() now works as follows.

If reliable stack traces are supported and save_stack_trace() is available,
it is used. If the function is not available but still reliable stack
traces are supported, we provide our implementation of save_stack_trace().
It is basically the original implementation copied from the kernel, with
only minor changes.

If reliable stack traces are not supported, kedr_save_stack_trace()
stores only one stack frame passed to it as one of the arguments.

    * LeakCheck: Handling of allocs and frees is now deferred via a work queue

Using a work queue allows to significantly reduce the time the replacement
functions spend with a spinlock held.

The internal API was revisited in several ways, not only to make use of
the work queue but also to hide some implementation-specific stuff that was
in the headers before (changes in our stack trace-related API made it
possible).
    
    * Added support for interception of kmalloc_order_trace()
kmalloc_order_trace() seems to have appeared in SLUB allocator in the kernel
2.6.38. kmalloc() unfolds to it in some cases.

    * Util: handled removal of obsoleted warning* fields from stacktrace_ops in kernel 3.0

'warning' and 'warning_symbol' fileds have been removed from stacktrace_ops
structure in the kernel.

Adjusted the implementation of kedr_save_stack_trace() accordingly.

    * Doc: Disabled generation of "title" attributes and, hence, the tooltips

By default, when generating HTML from DocBook XML with the standard XSL
stylesheets, "title" attribute was generated for the div areas corresponding
to the sections, etc. Because of this, the browsers showed the tooltips when
the mouse pointer was hovering over these areas, which was really annoying.

To fix this, I have disabled generation of "title" attributes.
    
    * Doc: Revisited the docs, rewrote several parts to make them clearer

    * Got rid of some warnings that showed up on Fedora 15

The warnings seemed to be quite benign in this case:
- for .trigger files, 'result' variable remained unused;
- for MiST Engine, the warning was about integer overflow in the fragments
like this:
        size_t a = ...
        size_t b = ...
        if (a > b && func(s[a - b]) ...)
        ...
I suppose, no integer overflow happens there. func(s[a - b]) is not even
evaluated if a <= b.

    * Core: Enhanced handler mechanism to support several handlers for a target function

It is now possible for several payload modules used simultaneously to process the same target functions. This allows, for example, to perform memory leak detection and fault simulation or some other kind of analysis at the same time. This is achieved by using "pre" handlers and "post" handlers in addition to the replacement functions. For a given target function there may be no more than one replacement function but any number of "pre" and "post" handlers. See "KEDR Reference" in the docs for details.

    * FSim: Decoupled call monitoring and fault simulation

The payload modules for fault simulation no longer deal with the trace themselves. If one needs to collect the trace during fault simulation, one should simply load payload modules both for fault simulation and for call monitoring. 

    * Conf: Fixed handling of kmem_cache_*_trace functions that have different signatures in SLAB and SLUB memory allocators
    
    * Util: Changed behaviour of capture trace program w.r.t. reading of the trace file in the blocking mode

The default behaviour of kedr_capture_trace program is now non-blocking reading of the trace. So the program will exit when there are no more messages in the trace.
Passing '-b' option turns the blocking mode on. In this case, the program will wait for a message in the trace to appear if it is needed.
In that mode, SIGINT signal simply turn reading mode to non-blocking.

    * Util: Fixed kedr_capture_trace to work correctly in session mode
    
    * mutex_trylock() function is now considered required on the target system rather than optional

    * Tracing: If ring buffer is not supported, turn off the components that use it.

The configuration system of KEDR now checks whether ring buffer is supported. If it is not, kedr_trace, call monitor payloads and capture trace tool will not be built.

Also the test for caller_address in the indicator was reworked in order not to use trace (and hence, the test no longer depends on the availability of ring buffer).

    * Tests: In tests for tracing, add 'wait' after killing process that reads the trace file.

This allows to avoid the situation when kedr_trace module is being unloaded while the trace file is still opened.

    * FSim: Fixed intermediate template for fault simulation payloads

The template 'forgot' fpoint.reuse_point of the initial datafile. In addition, the tests for the final template of fault simulation payloads were added.

    * FSim: Added support for renaming fault simulation point for generated fault simulation payloads.

Besides that, added tests for this new functionality. Renamed some points in standard payloads.

KEDR 0.2.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eugene A. Shatokhin <spectre@ispras.ru>:

    * build: Added support for cross-building

The build system has been revisited to allow building KEDR not only for the
very system where the build process takes place ("build system") but also
for a different one ("target system").

For example, this allows to build KEDR on Ubuntu x86-64 for Chromium OS
(x86-generic), to build KEDR for other versions or the kernel on the same
system, etc.

The mechanism uses "toolchain files". Two such files are already provided
(sources/cmake/platform/*.cmake), more can be created by the users.

For details on toolchain files, see the comments there as well as
http://www.itk.org/Wiki/CMake_Cross_Compiling
    
    * Added support for user-definable version suffixes

Using KEDR_VERSION_SUFFIX variable, one can specify a string to be appended
to the version of KEDR like "-devel", "-build1234", etc.

    * fsim: Spelling fixes

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEDR 0.2
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
Eugene A. Shatokhin <spectre@ispras.ru>:

    * Made several fixes for KEDR to be able to work on the versions 2.6.37 
and 2.6.38 of the kernel.
    * Cleaned up the KEDR core, payloads, examples and the tests: removed 
obsolete and unnecessary stuff, reduced code duplication.
    * Prepared LeakCheck plugin that allows to detect memory leaks in the 
kernel modules. Prepared the tests and documentation for it.
    * Revisited sample modules for char devices, got rid of mknod, etc.
    * Added support for call monitoring for 20 more functions (mostly - 
memory allocation and deallocation routines). Support for fault simulation 
for these functions was also provided where applicable.
    * Added support for fault simulation for vmalloc()-like functions.
    * Updated the build system: the presence of *node*-functions is now 
checked in a more reliable way (fixes issues with exported but unusable 
functions in Fedora 12-14 x86).
    * Made stack trace helper stuff available for all components of KEDR 
rather than for LeakCheck only.
    * Call monitoring: made processing of additional spinlock functions 
optional.
    * Core: fixed incorrect handling of failures of try_module_get() for 
payloads.
    * Build system: fixed: kernel version and ability to build modules 
were not checked.
    * Build system: added a check for stack trace reliability. If the system
does not provide reliable stack traces (e.g. neither CONFIG_FRAME_POINTER 
nor CONFIG_STACK_UNWIND is set), some components of KEDR should be disabled
(e.g. support for 'caller_address' in fault simulation). This is a temporary
workaround for the problems, for example, on Debian 6.
    * Added a test to additionally check (after KEDR is built) if 
save_stack_trace() is reliable.
    * Minor fixes: LC_ALL=C for awk, newlines at EOF, etc.
    * Many cosmetic fixes in the messages and comments.


Tsyvarev Andrey <tsyvarev@ispras.ru>:

    * Fixed issues concerning parallel builds (bug #017731)
    * Revisited kedr control script: added '--help' and '--version' options,
added '-f' option to specify configuration files.
    * Made support for the standard call monitoring and fault simulation 
payloads optional.
    * Replaced tracing mechanism based on trace events with our own one,
which is more suitable for KEDR. The new mechanism gets rid of the hacks 
like "nop" tracer, allows to channel the trace through several handler 
applications at once and provides more guarantees the messages are in 
appropriate order in the trace, even on SMP systems. It is built using the
same basic blocks provided by the kernel that ftrace and trace event 
mechanism uses: kernel markers, special ring buffer, etc.
    * Rewrote kedr_capture_trace tool to make use of the new tracing 
mechanism and to make the usage of the tool more intuitive.
    * Added support for 'caller_address' variable in fault simulation 
scenarios. This allows to restrict fault simulation to particular areas 
in the target module.
    * The controller no longer outputs messages about loading and unloading
of the target module to the trace. Payload modules now do this.
    * Removed dependency on Perl: the build system now uses shell commands 
instead when checking for the existence of the functions.
    * The tests for call interception no longer use trace. This allows to
better distinguish the errors related to tracing support from the errors
actually related to call interception.
    * Made 'caller_address' optional. Support for this variable can be turned 
off manually, it is also turned off if the system is unable to provide 
reliable call stack traces.

---------------------------------------------------------------------------
KEDR 0.1
---------------------------------------------------------------------------
This is the first public stable version of KEDR framework. 
Main features of this version:
    * support for call monitoring for the kernel modules;
    * support for fault simulation according to the scenarios chosen by 
the user;
    * the means to customize the analysis tools provided with KEDR and 
to build new tools on top of it.
