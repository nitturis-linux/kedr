This directory contains source files with names having the following format:
${f}.c. Each of the files is used in try-compile procedure to determine 
whether function 'f' exists in the kernel. Usually such kernel module 
contains the code using this function directly or indirectly.

The list of these files is hard-coded in the cmake module as 
'unreliable_functions_list'.
