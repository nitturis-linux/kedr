KEDR 0.2 released

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.1. Most significant changes:
    * Tracing subsystem has been completely rewritten to be more versatile 
and reliable even on SMP systems.
    * A memory leak detector (LeakCheck) has been implemented.
    * It is now possible to restrict fault simulation to particular areas 
in the target module (if the kernel provides reliable stack traces).
    * Several fixes have been made for KEDR to be able to work on the 
versions 2.6.37 and 2.6.38 of the kernel.
    * Call monitoring for 20 more functions is now supported. Support for 
fault simulation for many of these functions as well as for vmalloc() group
has also been provided.
    * The issues concerning parallel builds (bug #017731) have been fixed.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.
