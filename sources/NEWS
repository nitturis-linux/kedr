KEDR 0.3 released

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.2.1. Most significant changes:
    * Handling of intercepted function calls has been revisited to allow 
doing several kinds of analysis at the same time (e.g. performing fault 
simulation and memory leak detection simultaneously).
    * The components responsible for fault simulation are now decoupled 
from call monitoring (call tracing) facilities and can be used 
independently if necessary.
    * Several enhancements and fixes have been applied to the trace 
capturing utility.
    * Stack trace-related API has been revisited and simplified. If the 
kernel provides reliable stack traces, the API works now even if 
save_stack_trace() is not available.
    * Handling of allocations and frees in the memory leak detector is now 
deferred via a work queue. This allows to significantly reduce the time 
spent with locks held.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.2.1 released

The most significant change in this release is the enhancement of build 
system. It is now possible to build KEDR for a kernel different from the
one running on the build machine. It is also possible to build it for a 
different system (e.g. for Chromium OS, x86-generic). 

The usage instructions are available in KEDR Wiki:

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.2 released

This release provides several enhancements and various fixes compared 
to version 0.1. Most significant changes:
    * Tracing subsystem has been completely rewritten to be more versatile 
and reliable even on SMP systems.
    * A memory leak detector (LeakCheck) has been implemented.
    * It is now possible to restrict fault simulation to particular areas 
in the target module (if the kernel provides reliable stack traces).
    * Several fixes have been made for KEDR to be able to work on the 
versions 2.6.37 and 2.6.38 of the kernel.
    * Call monitoring for 20 more functions is now supported. Support for 
fault simulation for many of these functions as well as for vmalloc() group
has also been provided.
    * The issues concerning parallel builds (bug #017731) have been fixed.

See ChangeLog for detailed information about the changes in this version.

KEDR 0.1 released

This is the first public stable version of KEDR framework. 
Main features of this version:
    * support for call monitoring for the kernel modules;
    * support for fault simulation according to the scenarios chosen by 
the user;
    * the means to customize the analysis tools provided with KEDR and 
to build new tools on top of it.
